              depend on the type of travel arrangement you book with us, which
              will be either a booking for package travel or for one or more
              individual travel services. Regardless of the type of arrangement
              you book with us, the provider of your travel service will have
              its own terms and conditions (such as airline conditions of
              carriage, accommodation or car hire terms or hotels supplier terms
              or tour organizer terms and conditions). All such terms and
              conditions (including limitations of liability) apply to these

              the travel service provider’s terms and conditions is deemed to be
              invalid or unenforceable. Your travel service providers will be
              identified on your itinerary or travel documents and their
              respective terms and conditions will be available directly on
              their websites or by contacting them. Alternatively you can ask us
              for copies. You must read all applicable travel service provider
              terms and conditions carefully because in every case they will
              apply to the provision of your travel services.</p></div><div><h2>Package Travel Arranged By Us</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">A package is a pre-arranged, single-price combination of at least
              two of the following components: (a) transport – (b) accommodation
              – or (c) other tourist services accounting for a significant
              proportion of the package. Packages cover a period of more than
              twenty-four hours or include overnight accommodation. Your rights
              in relation to packages arranged by us are set out in these
              Booking Conditions (which are deemed to incorporate all terms and
              conditions of each travel service provider for the various
              components of your package travel arrangements). Please note that
              you also have rights under the Package Travel, Package Holidays
              and Package Tours Regulations 1992, a copy of which can be
              accessed at the following link:
              legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/3288/contents/made (“Package Travel
              Regulations”).</p></div><div><h2>Schedule changes</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">All departure and arrival times on your flight ticket are provided
              by the airline and are estimates only. They may change due to air
              traffic control restrictions, weather conditions or operational
              requirements. We recommend that you contact the airline or visit
              the airline’s website to confirm your scheduled departure time 24
              hours prior to your flight. You should also confirm departure
              times for each onward flight. In the event of schedule changes,
              failure to reconfirm any sector of your itinerary may result in
              you needing to purchase a new flight.</p></div><div><h2>When You Change Your Booking</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If, after our confirmation invoice has been issued, you wish to
              change your travel arrangements in any way, for example your
              chosen travel dates or accommodation, we will do our utmost to
              make these changes but it may not always be possible. Any request
              for changes to be made must be in writing from the lead–named
              traveler who made the booking. You will be asked to pay our
              administration charge of £75 per passenger per booking (or such
              other amount specified in your travel documents), plus any
              additional travel service provider change or cancellation fees.
              Where we incur any liability for a travel service provider change
              or cancellation fee for any booking which you change, you agree to
              compensate us for the amount of that fee. You should be aware that
              costs could increase closer to the departure date. When changing
              travel arrangements we may have to re book you to current fares
              and rates, which may result in an increase in the cost of your
              arrangements, in addition to our administration charge and the
              travel service provider’s change fees. No date changes are
              permitted outside of your ticket’s validity period. ‘Minimum stay’
              and ‘maximum stay’ rules apply to return and multi-stop flights.
              Certain travel arrangements (e.g. advance purchase tickets and
              non-flexible fares) may not be changeable after a reservation has
              been made and any alteration could incur a cancellation charge of
              up to 100% of the service cost. Name changes are not permitted in
              any instance.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you have purchased a return flight, multi-stop or round the
              world flight and you do not check in on a confirmed flight, the
              airline will register you as a ‘no show’ and your tickets on your
              subsequent flights will be cancelled by the airline. Please
              contact us as soon as possible if you do not intend to check in
              for a confirmed reservation in these circumstances.</p></div><div><h2></h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"></p></div><div><h2>When You Cancel Your Booking</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">You may cancel your travel arrangements at any time, however
              please note that certain travel arrangements may be
              non-refundable. Written notification from the lead-named traveller
              must be received at the branch where the booking was made. Since
              we incur costs in cancelling your travel arrangements, you will
              need to pay our administration charge of £125 per person per
              booking (or such other amount specified in your travel documents).
              In addition to our administration charge, you will have to pay the
              travel service provider’s applicable cancellation charges.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you have made a booking with us for your Journeys the cancellation fees will be an amount determined in accordance with the table below, except where otherwise indicated.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If the reason for your cancellation is covered under the terms of your travel insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim these charges from your travel insurer. Refunds will only be made available to the person named on the booking payment receipt, unless otherwise agreed in writing by all travelers listed on a booking.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Your refund and remedy rights as set out in these Booking Conditions are subject to your rights under the Package Travel Regulations and the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, the following cancellation fees apply to bookings for your Journeys only. Days before departure within which written notice is received by us Cancellation fee (% of total Journey)</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">More than 70 days Deposit only</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">57-70 days Deposit + 45% of total Journey</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">37-56 days Deposit + 50% of total Journey</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">28-36 days Deposit + 65% of total Journey</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">15-27 days Deposit + 90% of total Journey</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">14 days or less Full booking value</p></div><div><h2>When we change or cancel your booking</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Occasionally a travel service provider may have to make changes to your original booking. We do not accept any liability or costs incurred that may result from these changes, other than in accordance with the Package Travel Regulations. Most of these changes will be minor and we will advise you of them at the earliest possible date. We will advise you of the carrier operating each flight in your itinerary. Any changes to the carrier after you have received your tickets will be notified to you as soon as possible and in all cases at check-in or at the boarding gate. Please note that carriers may be subject to change. Such a change is deemed to be a minor change. Other examples of minor changes include alteration of your flight departure time by less than 12 hours, changes to aircraft type and change of accommodation to a comparable or higher standard. No compensation is payable in respect of minor changes.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">In certain circumstances we or a travel service provider may be required to cancel your travel arrangements (for example, if the minimum number of travelers required for a tour or excursion is not reached or for reasons of force majeure, pandemic or epidemic illness or if you fail to pay the final balance by the due date). In these circumstances (except where you have failed to pay the final balance) you can either have a refund of all money paid or, if available, accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements of comparable standard (we will refund any price difference if the alternative is of a lower value).</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you have booked a package arranged by us and it is necessary to cancel or make major changes to your arrangements we will, in addition to the above, pay you compensation as follows:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">55-29 days prior to travel: £15.00</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">28-15 days prior to travel: £25.00</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">14-8 days prior to travel: £35.00</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">7-0 days prior to travel: £45.00</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Please refer to the section titled ‘Our responsibility for your
              booking’ for more information in this regard.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Under EU law (EC 261/2004) you have rights in some circumstances to refunds or compensation from your airline in cases of denied boarding, cancellation or delay to flights. Details of these rights are published at EU airports and are also available from your airline. However, reimbursement by an airline of the cost of a flight that forms part of a package does not automatically entitle you to a refund of your entire package travel arrangement cost from us.</p></div><div><h2>Passports &amp; visas</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">All travellers must have a valid passport for any international travel and many countries require at least six months’ validity from the date of return. Some countries also require a machine-readable passport and/or unstamped available pages. When assisting with an international travel booking, we will assume that all travellers on the booking have a valid passport. If this is not the case, you must let us know. It is important that you ensure that you have valid passports, visas and re-entry permits which meet the requirements of immigration and other government authorities (including, in certain cases, visas for transit points). Any fines, penalties, payments, delays or expenditures incurred as a result of such documents not meeting the requirements of those authorities will be your sole responsibility (except to the extent caused by fault on our part). We do not accept any responsibility if you cannot travel because you have not complied with any passport, visa or immigration requirements. If you need information regarding visa and other travel document requirements for your trip please let us know or visit<!-- -->https://schengenexpert.co.uk<!-- -->. If you are a British citizen we will provide you with general information on visa and passport requirements that apply to international travel bookings you make with us. For all passport holders, our consultants can obtain specific information from an external visa advisory service provider on your behalf (if you wish, we can assist you to obtain visas through this external service and fees will apply). We do not warrant the accuracy of information provided by any external service and accept no liability for any loss or damage which you may suffer in reliance on it (except to the extent caused by fault on our part). Please allow adequate time to obtain any such advice or documents.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you are travelling to Australia, Canada or the United States please be advised that there are compulsory pre-registration requirements for their visa waiver programs. ESTA visa is compulsory for all USA bound travel. For Canada and Australia you must have ETA visa as well to travel these territories. If you have registered before, please check your registration is valid and has not lapsed. Please note, you may not meet the eligibility requirements and may be required to obtain a visa.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you are travelling to South Africa with a person under the age
              of 18 you will be asked to show the child’s full unabridged birth
              certificate. There are additional requirements if the child is
              travelling with only one parent, with neither biological parent,
              or unaccompanied. Failure to provide this information on check in
              will result in passengers being denied boarding.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">It is a requirement for some air carriers to provide personal information, including passport information, about all passengers on their aircraft. The data will be collected when you check-in (either online or at the airport) or, in some circumstances, will be required when you make your booking.</p></div><div><h2>Our responsibility for your booking</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">In all circumstances, we will not be liable where any failure in
              the performance or provision of your travel arrangements is due

              member in your group (b) any third party not connected with the

              unforeseeable or unavoidable (c) unusual and unforeseeable
              circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which could
              not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised or
              (d) an event which we or a travel service provider, even with all
              due care, could not foresee or forestall (including but not to
              war, threat of war, riot, civil disturbances, industrial dispute,
              terrorist activity and its consequences, natural or other disaster

              technical problems with transport and similar events). Our
              liability will in all cases be in accordance with and/or in an
              identical manner to: (a) the terms and conditions of the travel
              service providers that provide your travel arrangements (which, by
              making a booking with us, you acknowledge form part of these
              Booking Conditions) – and (b) any relevant international
              conventions, for example the Montreal Convention in respect of
              travel by air, the Athens Convention in respect of travel by sea,
              the Berne Convention in respect of travel by rail and the Paris
              Convention in respect of the provision of accommodation which set
              time limits for notifications/claims and limit the amount of
              compensation that can be claimed for death, injury, delay to
              passengers/guests and loss, damage and delay to luggage. Copies of
              international conventions and relevant travel service providers’
              terms and conditions are available online. Alternatively you can
              ask us for copies either over the phone or in-store.</p></div><div><h2>Package Travel Arranged By Us</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">In accordance with the Package Travel Regulations, if we have arranged a package for you and the travel arrangements are not performed with reasonable skill and care we will make good those arrangements or pay you appropriate compensation if this has affected the enjoyment of your trip. Our liability in respect of packages arranged by us, except in cases involving death, injury or illness, is to a maximum of 2 times the cost of your package travel arrangement. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you have not received any benefit at all from your package travel arrangement. Any amounts you receive from travel service providers or travel insurance will be deducted from any sum paid to you as compensation by us.</p></div><div><h2>Your Financial Protection</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3"><strong>SCHENGEN EXPERT<!-- --> Ltd T/A Fast dealing in worldwide Flights and Holiday packages.</strong></p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Many of the flights and flight-inclusive travel arrangements we arrange on your behalf are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all travel and travel services. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts not listed will not be ATOL protected. For more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate. When you buy an ATOL protected fight or flight inclusive travel through us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. If your booking (or part of it) is ATOL protected, we, or the travel service provider identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the booking service and arrange the travel services as listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the travel service provider are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the travel services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If we, or the travel service provider identified on your ATOL
              certificate, are unable to arrange or provide the services listed
              (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or
              otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air
              Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you
              under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment
              or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims
              which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the
              non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the
              travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You
              also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another
              body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the
              ATOL scheme. If you book a package which does not include flights,
              our ABTA membership means that we provide financial protection for
              your money. If you book other travel arrangements, such as
              accommodation only, this protection doesn’t apply.</p></div><div><h2>Prices and payment</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">All prices are subject to availability and can be withdrawn or varied without notice. Prices are per person and inclusive of tax unless otherwise indicated. Accommodation (if included) is based on twin share, quad share, unless otherwise indicated. Advertised prices may be to travel within specified dates. We will confirm the correct price with you at the time of payment. Prices are not guaranteed until full payment is made. To confirm your travel arrangements you may be required to pay a deposit per person. All deposits are non-refundable and non-transferable for changes of mind or cancellations by you. We will advise you of the amount of the deposit and date for final payment at the time of your booking. For online bookings, full payment is required at the time of purchase.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">If you have made a booking with us from our ‘Journeys’ ranges you
              will be required to pay a deposit of £100 per person for economy
              class flights and £200 per person for premium economy, business
              and first class flights. An additional deposit will be required
              for any tour or cruise or for certain airfares which form part of
              your Journey. The balance for your Journey must be paid no later
              than 10 weeks prior to departure or such earlier time that we
              notify you. Please check your quote or invoice to confirm whether
              your travel arrangements are from us.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Certain airfares and services (including some airfares and services in the Journeys) are booked at especially competitive rates which may require payment in full at the time of booking and may be non-refundable.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">We will collect all mandatory taxes, however some countries may charge additional departure, hotel or other taxes that must be paid locally. We advise travelers to retain sufficient local currency to meet these charges.</p></div><div><h2>Payment by debit and credit card</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">We accept most major debit and credit cards. You authorize us to charge all amounts payable by you in relation to the services provided to the card designated by you. If payment is not received from the issuer for any reason, you agree to pay us all amounts due immediately on demand.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">Payment by bank transfer (not applicable to online bookings) If you are paying by this method you will need to request account details from your consultant and make the payment at least three business days prior to the actual due date. You must notify your consultant of your payment once it has been made.</p></div><div><h2>How do I make a complaint?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-9l3uo3">We aim to provide you with an amazing travel experience. However, if you have a problem during your trip, please inform the relevant travel service provider (e.g. your hotelier) and your travel consultant as soon as possible who will endeavor to put things right. If your complaint is not resolved locally, please follow this up within 28 days of your return home by writing to our Customer Services Department at <!-- -->https://schengenexpert.co.uk<!-- --> giving your booking reference and all other relevant information. It is strongly recommended that you communicate any complaint to the travel service provider in question as well as your travel consultant without delay. If you fail to follow this procedure we will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate and rectify your complaint whilst you were travelling and this may affect your rights. Out of normal office hours you may also contact our emergency assistance department on 0203 884 0131.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer_footer__2I8Xl"><div
